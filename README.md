# localwriter: A LibreOffice Writer extension for local generative AI

Consider donating to support development: https://ko-fi.com/johnbalis

## About

This is a LibreOffice Writer extension that enables inline generative editing with local inference. It's compatible with language models supported by `text-generation-webui` and `ollama`. Starting from version 0.0.8, it uses `LiteLLM` for model interaction, providing a unified interface to various model backends.

## Features

This extension provides two powerful commands for LibreOffice Writer:

### Extend Selection

**Hotkey:** `CTRL + q`

*   This uses a language model to predict what comes after the selected text. There are a lot of ways to use this.
*   Some example use cases for this include: writing a story or an email given a particular prompt, adding additional possible items to a grocery list, or summarizing the selected text.

### Edit Selection

**Hotkey:** `CTRL + e`

*   A dialog box appears to prompt the user for instructions about how to edit the selected text, then the selected text is replaced by the edited text.
*   Some examples for use cases for this include changing the tone of an email, translating text to a different language, and semantically editing a scene in a story.

## Setup

### LibreOffice Extension Installation

1.  Download the latest version of Localwriter via the [releases page](https://github.com/balis-john/localwriter/releases).
2.  Open LibreOffice.
3.  Navigate to `Tools > Extensions`.
4.  Click `Add` and select the downloaded `.oxt` file.
5.  Follow the on-screen instructions to install the extension.

### Backend Setup

To use Localwriter, you need a backend model runner.  Options include `text-generation-webui` and `Ollama`. Choose the backend that best suits your needs. Ollama is generally easier to set up. In either of these options, you will have to download and set a model. 

#### text-generation-webui

*   Installation instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui).
*   Docker image available [here](https://github.com/Atinoda/text-generation-webui-docker).

After installation and model setup:

1.  Enable the local OpenAI API (this ensures the API responds in a format similar to OpenAI).
2.  Verify that the intended model is working (e.g., openchat3.5, suitable for 8GB VRAM setups).
3.  Set the endpoint in Localwriter to `localhost:5000` (or the configured port).

#### Ollama

*   Installation instructions are available [here](https://ollama.com/).
*   Download and use a model (gemma3 isn't bad)
*   Ensure the API is enabled.
*   Set the endpoint in Localwriter to `localhost:11434` (or the configured port).
*   Manually set the model name. ([This is required for Ollama to work](https://ask.libreoffice.org/t/localwriter-0-0-5-installation-and-usage/122241/5?u=jbalis))

## Settings

In the settings, you can configure:

*   Maximum number of additional tokens for "Extend Selection."
*   Maximum number of additional tokens (above the number of letters in the original selection) for "Edit Selection."
*   Custom "system prompts" for both "Extend Selection" and "Edit Selection." These prompts are prepended to the selection before sending it to the language model.  For example, you can use a sample of your writing to guide the model's style.
*   Endpoint URL/Port for connecting to the backend model runner.
*   Model name (required for Ollama and some other backends).

Help with development is always welcome. localwriter has a number of outstanding feature requests by users. Feel free to work on any of them, and you can help improve freedom-respecting local AI.

### Local Development Setup

For developers who want to modify or contribute to Localwriter, you can run and test the extension directly from your source code without packaging it into an `.oxt` file. This allows for quick iteration and seeing changes reflected in the LibreOffice UI.

1. **Clone the Repository (if not already done):**
   - Clone the Localwriter repository to your local machine if you haven't already:
     ```
     git clone https://github.com/balis-john/localwriter.git
     cd localwriter
     ```

2. **Vendoring LiteLLM for Development:**
   - You need to vendor the library and its dependencies into the `lib/` directory:
     ```
     pip install litellm -t lib
     ```
   - Ensure all dependencies are included in `lib/` to avoid import issues in LibreOffice's Python environment.

3. **Register the Extension Temporarily:**
   - Use the `unopkg` tool to register the extension directly from your repository folder. This avoids the need to package the extension as an `.oxt` file during development.
   - For development, you'll need to remove and re-add the extension each time you make changes:
     ```
     unopkg remove org.extension.sample; yes yes | unopkg add . > /dev/null
     ```
   - On Linux, `unopkg` is often located at `/usr/lib/libreoffice/program/unopkg`. Adjust the command if needed:
     ```
     /usr/lib/libreoffice/program/unopkg remove org.extension.sample; yes yes | /usr/lib/libreoffice/program/unopkg add . > /dev/null
     ```
   - Alternatively, use the provided Makefile which provides these commands:
     ```bash
     make dev-install   # First time setup
     make dev-refresh   # After making changes
     make dev-run       # To start LibreOffice
     make package       # Create distribution .oxt file
     ```
     Run `make help` to see all available commands.

4. **Restart LibreOffice:**
   - Close and reopen LibreOffice Writer or Calc. You should see the "localwriter" menu with options like "Extend Selection", "Edit Selection", and "Settings" in the menu bar.

5. **Make and Test Changes:**
   - Edit the source files (e.g., `main.py`) directly in your repository folder using your preferred editor.
   - After making changes, restart LibreOffice to reload the updated code. Test the functionality and UI elements (dialogs, menu actions) directly in LibreOffice.
   - Note: Restarting is often necessary for Python script changes to take effect, as LibreOffice caches modules.

6. **Commit Changes to Git:**
   - Since you're working directly in your Git repository, commit your changes as needed:
     ```
     git add main.py
     git commit -m "Updated extension logic for ExtendSelection"
     ```

7. **Unregister the Extension (Optional):**
   - If you need to remove the temporary registration, use:
     ```
     unopkg remove org.extension.sample
     ```
   - Replace `org.extension.sample` with the identifier from `description.xml` if different.

### Building the Extension Package

To create a distributable `.oxt` package:

In a terminal, change directory into the localwriter repository top-level directory, then run the following command:

````
zip -r localwriter.oxt \
  Accelerators.xcu \
  Addons.xcu \
  assets \
  description.xml \
  main.py \
  META-INF \
  registration \
  README.md \
  lib
````

This will create the file `localwriter.oxt` which you can open with libreoffice to install the localwriter extension. You can also change the file extension to .zip and manually unzip the extension file, if you want to inspect a localwriter `.oxt` file yourself. It is all human-readable, since python is an interpreted language.

**Note on Vendoring LiteLLM for Distribution:**
- Before building the `.oxt` file for distribution, ensure the `lib/` directory contains the vendored `LiteLLM` library and its dependencies. You can do this by running:
  ```
  mkdir -p lib
  pip install litellm -t lib
  ```
- This ensures that the extension is self-contained and works in environments without external Python package access.
